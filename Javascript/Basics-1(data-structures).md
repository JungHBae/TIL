# A bit about some basic types of Data Structures in Javascript.

Data Structures can be divided into two general types: **Linear Data Structure** and **Non-linear Data structure**. 

## Linear Data Structures:

### Arrays

An array is a collection of elements, where each element can be accessed by its index number. 
Arrays in JavaScript can store any type of data, and their length can be changed dynamically.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a collection of elements, where each element contains a reference to the next element in the list. 
Linked lists in JavaScript can be implemented using **objects**, 
and they are useful when you need to add or remove elements from the beginning or end of the list frequently.

### Stacks

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
In a stack, elements can only be added or removed from the top of the stack. 
Stacks in JavaScript can be implemented using **arrays**, and they are useful when you need to keep track of a sequence of operations, such as in an undo/redo feature.
  
## Non-linear Data Structures:

### Trees

Trees are a hierarchical data structure that can be used to represent a wide variety of real-world data. 
In JavaScript, trees can be implemented using object literals or classes.

### Graphs

Graphs are a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. 
In JavaScript, graphs can be implemented using **object literals** or **classes**.

### Sets

Sets are a data structure that represents a collection of unique elements. 
In JavaScript, sets can be implemented using the built-in **Set** object.

### Maps

Maps are a data structure that represents a collection of key-value pairs. 
In JavaScript, maps can be implemented using the built-in **Map** object.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables are a data structure that use a hash function to map keys to their corresponding values. 
In JavaScript, hash tables can be implemented using **object literals** or the **Map** object.
